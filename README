To compile this project:

    First opencv needs to be installed (instructions in http://docs.opencv.org/doc/tutorials/introduction/linux_install/linux_install.html)

        1. Download an unzip the latest opencv lib
        2. Execute cmake (it can be installed with apt-get if it is not) to create the makefiles. Assuming you are inside the unzipped folder:
            mkdir release
            cd release
            cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local ..
        3. Compile opencv (it can take a while)
            make
        4. Install opencv to the system default lib folders, so it will be found when compiling and linking
            sudo make install

    To build the face server, from inside its folder, execute:

        cmake .
        make

To run it:

    ./FaceRec at_test.txt name_map.txt

    or call run.sh

To set it up as a service:

    1. Run make_dist.sh to create a distributable folder.
    2. Copy the contents of the ./dist folder to a folder called /home/cloudlet/face_server in the target VM.
    3. Copy the face_server.conf file present in there to the /etc/init/ folder
    4. Execute "sudo start face_server" to manually start the service (it will autostart if the machine is rebooted)
