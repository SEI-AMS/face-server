First opencv needs to be installed (instructions in http://docs.opencv.org/doc/tutorials/introduction/linux_install/linux_install.html)

1. Download an unzip the latest opencv lib
2. Execute cmake (it can be installed with apt-get if it is not) to create the makefiles. Assuming you are inside the unzipped folder:
    mkdir release
    cd release
    cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local ..
3. Compile opencv (it can take a while)
    make
4. Install opencv to the system default lib folders, so it will be found when compiling and linking
    sudo make install

To build the face server, from inside its folder, execute:

cmake .
make

To run it:

./FaceRec at_test.txt name_map.txt
